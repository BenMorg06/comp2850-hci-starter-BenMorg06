# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-21 11:32]
**Context**: Partially Sited
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: 13 minutes

### Q1: How often do you use a task manager
**Response**: "I use a task manager every single day - honestly, I’d be lost without it! Between juggling work, home, and the kids' activities, it’s the only way I stay on top of things. It’s a mix of recurring tasks like appointments and spur-of-the-moment notes for things that pop up.

**Observations**: 
- Mentioned time management (juggling different parts of life)
- Mix of regular and spotaneous events ()
- 

**Themes**: `time_management`, `stress`

### Q2: What frustrations do you have using your current task management tool?
**Response**: One of my biggest frustrations is the lack of customisation for accessibility. Being partially sighted, I often struggle with small text, poor colour contrasts, or icons that aren’t clearly distinguishable. It’s even more difficult when there’s no voice control integration - I’d love to be able to dictate tasks quickly when I’m in a rush. Sometimes, apps feel overly cluttered with features that I don’t use, which makes navigating them harder than it should be.

**Observations**:
- Lack of clear visibility (non-accesible text, colours, etc.)
- Dictation
- Cluttered apps (Too much going on at once)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `dictation`, `clutter`

### Q3: Do you ever lose track of tasks?
**Response**: Yes, I do occasionally lose track of tasks—it happens most often when I’ve got a big to-do list and the app doesn’t prioritise reminders or let me flag things clearly. Sometimes I’ll miss something because the notification isn’t prominent enough or I didn’t catch it properly due to unclear text or design. It’d be helpful if task managers could automatically organise things based on urgency or importance.

**Observations**:
- Unclear text or design
- Lack of Priority and Flags
- Cogntive overload

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`. `cognitive_overload`

### Q4: Have you ever had to work without a mouse?
**Response**: Yes, I’ve had to work without a mouse on several occasions! It’s usually when my hands are full, or I’m on my phone. Honestly, keyboard shortcuts or voice commands become essential in those moments. But, some apps don’t make navigating without a mouse easy—it can feel like a maze of tabs and menus.

**Observations**:
- Without a mouse felt like a maze
- Situational impairment (phone or hands full)
- Keyboard shortcuts & voice commands are essential

**Themes**: `keyboard_navigation`, `situational_impairment`

### Q5: Do you often work in bright-sunlight or with a screen reader?
**Response**: Yes, I do both! Bright sunlight can make it really hard to see the screen—glare is such a challenge, and some apps don’t have great contrast modes to help with that. As for screen readers, I use one occasionally when my eyes are strained or if I need to multitask. However, not every app plays nicely with them—it’s frustrating when things don’t read out properly or navigation gets stuck

**Observations**:
- Constrast Modes (situational disability)
- Sunlight makes screen-glare bad
- Apps not configured well for screen-readers

**Themes**: `screen_reader`, `constrast`

### Q6: Is there a feature you wish your current app had?
**Response**: One feature I really wish my current app had is smarter voice integration. It would be amazing if I could just say something like, "Remind me to pick up the kids at 4pm tomorrow," and it automatically adds it to the right spot without me having to fiddle around. Also, a customisable interface would be brilliant—like being able to adjust text size, simplify layouts, or choose high-contrast themes so it’s easier to use.

**Observations**:
- Voice dictation
- Customisable interface

**Themes**: `dictation`, `customisation`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Lack of good voice dictation -> situational disability
2. Poor contrast and visibility -> situational disability
3. Lack of task prioritisation -> confusion
4. Poor screen-reader compatibility -> temporary exclusion

**Job story ideas**:
- "When my hands are full, I want to be able to speak to the application to add a task and give it the correct date and time etc."
- "When I have lots of tasks, I want to be able to order tasks by urgency."
- "When my eyes are strained, I want to be able to navigate a website without needing to look at a screen"
